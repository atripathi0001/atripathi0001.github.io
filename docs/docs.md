This is the guide to install Ruby
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

### I assume you have already downloaded and installed Ruby. Hereâ€™s what you need to do next:

- Run <code>gem install jekyll bundler</code>.
- Copy the repo in your desired folder.
- Enter into the folder by executing <code>cd name-of-the-folder</code>.
- Run <code>bundle install</code>.
- If you want to access and customize the project, use <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>. This way it will be accessible on <code>http://localhost:4000</code>.

### Now the project would be running locally

One thing to remember - true is on, false is off.
