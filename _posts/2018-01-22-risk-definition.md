## Risk

 
[Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) is the potential of gaining or losing something of value.


Risk(R) could be measured as   

risk(R) = likelihood(L) Ã— impact(I)   

where, 

I = Technical Impact * Business Impact  
L = Threat agent factors * Vulnerability factors  



R can be function of four factors:  
    A = Value of the assets  
    T = the likelihood of the threat  
    V = the nature of vulnerability i.e. the likelihood that can be exploited (proportional to the potential benefit for the attacker and inversely proportional to the cost of exploitation)  
    I = the likely impact, the extent of the harm

## Risk Management 

We manage risk in one of the following ways-  
- Risk transference  
- Risk avoidance  
- Risk reduction 
- Risk acceptance 
- Risk mitigation 
 

After the risk has been managed the we do risk assessment on residual risk  
 
Risk assessment  
	
- qualitative risk assessment    
- quantitative risk assessment    
- 	Single Loss Expectancy(SLE) * Annualized rate of occurrence(ARO) = Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
